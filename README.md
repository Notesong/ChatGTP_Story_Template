# ChatGTP Story Template

This template helps to provide a completely customizable (and totally manual) way to create or edit a story using OpenAI ChatGTP and Python. You choose what the AI 'remembers', instead of using ChatGTP's website and having less control over input, output, tokens, and such. The template is set up to use GTP 3.5 Turbo, but you can edit the template to use any version you wish.

In this template, OpenAI's ChatGTP is accessed through its API, so you must create an account with them to obtain a key. If it's your first time using OpenAI, you will receive a $5 credit which will last 3 months before it expires (this information is current as of 5/1/23). After that, you will pay only for what system resources you use on their servers.
