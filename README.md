# ChatGTP Story Template

This template helps to provide a completely customizable (and totally manual) way to create or edit a story using OpenAI ChatGTP and Python.  You choose what the AI 'remembers', instead of using ChatGTP's website and having less control over input, output, tokens, and such. 

OpenAI's ChatGTP is accessed through its API, so you must create an account with them to obtain a key.  If it's your first time using OpenAI, you will recieve a $5 credit which will last 3 months before it expires (at this time).  After that, you can pay for only what system resourses you use on their servers.
